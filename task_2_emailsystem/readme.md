# Task 2 - Email System

A PHP based email system design.
 
Notes:

+ The complete object oriented structure as requested can be found under the classes directory.
+ You can find a test coverage report in /report.
+ The scenario described in the task can be executed by running runtask.php from command line. It will setup the subscriber lists and fake send the emails.
+ No dependencies other than PHPUnit for testing and composer's autoloader.
+ No database (or generally any persistence layer was used).
+ E-Mails are not being sent out but E-Mail sending component (MailTransport.php) is separate, so it can be implemented when required.
